# SimplePaintBrushApp

What is it?
============

This simple drawing application provides users an ability to draw arbitrary shapes using their color of choice. The application also provides
an ability to clear the entire drawing as well as an undo functionality to just erase the last drawn shape.

How to use it?
===============

(a) Choose a color by moving along the circular color wheel. There is a small circle that displays the actual color in the color wheel at the
position of users click. Click on the centre color circle to set the paint brush color. By default, the paint brush is blue in color.

(b) Draw any shape(s). If a new color is needed, go back to step (a) to choose a new color.

(c) If the last drawn drawing is not what the user intended, use the undo button to erase it.

(d) If a new drawing is needed, clear the existing one using the clear button.

Additional features for future improvements and todos:
======================================================

(a) Add an eraser to provide more fine grained erasing functionality.

(b) Provide a save functionality to let the users save their drawings.

(c) Add unit tests to make the application more robust.

(d) Testing was done on a Nexus 5X emulator.  Do more testing on other hardware profiles.

(e) Do rotation testing.
